## Simple Responsive Grids


## Table Grids
Table grids differ from standard grids in that you specify the column sizes in the container. This is useful for when you have dynamic content and don't know the exact number of columns you will have, or if your columns don't evenly fit into a 12 column system.

## Push & Pull
The `push` and `pull` classes will push or pull an element the number of columns you specify.

## Settings
If you're using Sass, you can set the variables before you include any files to change the default settings. You can find the defaults in settings.scss.
